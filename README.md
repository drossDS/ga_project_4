# **Alzheimer's Identification in MRI Images**

#### Problem statement:
>Alzheimer’s disease is a type of dementia that progressively worsens, first affecting individuals’ memory and eventually attacking areas of the brain responsible for controlling basic cognition and bodily function.<br> Alzheimer’s is one of the leading causes of death in adults 65 and older [[1]]. While there is currently no cure for Alzheimer’s, treatment options are available to slow the progression of the disease [[2]].  Thus, early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s is crucial for effective treatment and disease management [[4]]. Further, identifying patients with early stages of Alzheimer’s may help increase the pool of participants for medical trials which seek to find a cure for this disease.<br> 
A variety of brain imaging techniques (such as MRIs) can be used to track the progress of dementia and medical imaging is one of the key areas where data science classification methods are currently being explored as a means to help medical professionals interpret the data they collect.<br> 
To that end, we will build a multiclass image classification model employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify levels of dementia progression of 6400 MRI images which have been previously categorized into 4 classes:  no dementia, very mild dementia, mild dementia, and moderate dementia.<br> 
A second goal of this study will be to determine if a binary classification model can more accurately detect very mild dementia by training a CNN exclusively on brain images with no signs of dementia and images with very mild dementia.
